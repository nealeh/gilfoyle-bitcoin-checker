# gilfoyle-bitcoin-checker

Inspired by Gilfoyle from the TV series Silicon Valley, this script checks the Bitcoin price at Coinbase and alerts if the price goes down at least 10%. 

In the show, the song You Suffer by Napalm Death is used as an alert. It's only one second long, but it's a violent one second! To avoid copyright infringement I haven't included the song in this repo, you will need to add it (or another song) yourself and update the "playsound()" call on line 37 of webs.py
